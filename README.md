# About this site

This website primarily serves as a platform for viewing Mr.MarketWatch's stock market predictions. Mr. MarketWatch is an algorithm my friend and I are currently working on to predict whether to buy or sell stocks realtime. While this algorithm is still a wip, follow this repo for a more refined dev in a few weeks!
